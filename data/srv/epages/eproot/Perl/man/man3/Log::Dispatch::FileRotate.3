.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides a simple object for logging to files under the
Log::Dispatch::* system, and automatically rotating them according to
different constraints. This is basically a Log::Dispatch::File wrapper
with additions. To that end the arguments
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        name, min_level, filename and  mode
.Ve
.PP
behave the same as Log::Dispatch::File. So see its man page 
(perldoc Log::Dispatch::File)
.PP
The arguments size and max specify the maximum size and maximum
number of log files created. The size defaults to 10M and the max number
of files defaults to 1. If DatePattern is not defined then we default to
working in size mode. That is, use size values for deciding when to rotate.
.PP
Once DatePattern is defined FileRotate will move into time mode. Once
this happens file rotation ignores size constraints and uses the defined
date pattern constraints.
.PP
If you setup a config file using \fILog::Log4perl::init_and_watch()\fR or the
like, you can switch between modes just by commenting out the DatePattern
line.
.PP
When using DatePattern make sure \s-1TZ\s0 is defined correctly and that the \s-1TZ\s0
you use is understood by Date::Manip. We use Date::Manip to generate our
recurrences. Bad \s-1TZ\s0 equals bad recurrences equals surprises! Read the
Date::Manip man page for more details on \s-1TZ\s0.
.PP
DatePattern will default to a daily rotate if your entered pattern is
incorrect. You will also get a warning message.
.PP
If you have multiple writers that were started at different times you
will find each writer will try to rotate the log file at a recurrence
calculated from its start time. To sync all the writers just use a config
file and update it after starting your last writer. This will cause
Log::Dispatch::FileRotate\->\fInew()\fR to be called by each of the writers
close to the same time, and if your recurrences aren't too close together
all should sync up just nicely.
.PP
I initially aasumed a long runinng process but it seems people are using
this module as part of short running \s-1CGI\s0 programs. So, now we look at the
last modified time stamp of the log file and compare it to a previous
occurance of a DatePattern, on startup only. If the file stat shows
the mtime to be earlier than the previous recurrance then I rotate the
log file.
.PP
We handle multiple writers using \fIflock()\fR.
.SH "DatePattern"
.IX Header "DatePattern"
As I said earlier we use Date::Manip for generating our recurrence
events. This means we can understand Date::Manip's recurrence patterns
and the normal log4j DatePatterns. We don't use DatePattern to define the
extension of the log file though.
.PP
DatePattern can therefore take forms like:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&      Date::Manip style
\&            0:0:0:0:5:30:0       every 5 hours and 30 minutes
\&            0:0:0:2*12:30:0      every 2 days at 12:30 (each day)
\&            3*1:0:2:12:0:0       every 3 years on Jan 2 at noon
\&
\&      DailyRollingFileAppender log4j style
\&            yyyy\-MM              every month
\&            yyyy\-ww              every week
\&            yyyy\-MM\-dd           every day
\&            yyyy\-MM\-dd\-a         every day at noon
\&            yyyy\-MM\-dd\-HH        every hour
\&            yyyy\-MM\-dd\-HH\-MM     every minute
.Ve
.PP
To specify multiple recurrences in a single string separate them with a
semicolon:
        yyyy-MM-dd; 0:0:0:2*12:30:0
.PP
This says we want to rotate every day \s-1AND\s0 every 2 days at 12:30. Put in
as many as you like.
.PP
A complete description of Date::Manip recurrences is beyond us here
except to quote (from the man page):
.PP
.Vb 4
\&           A recur description is a string of the format
\&           Y:M:W:D:H:MN:S .  Exactly one of the colons may
\&           optionally be replaced by an asterisk, or an asterisk
\&           may be prepended to the string.
\&
\&           Any value "N" to the left of the asterisk refers to
\&           the "Nth" one.  Any value to the right of the asterisk
\&           refers to a value as it appears on a calendar/clock.
\&           Values to the right can be listed a single values,
\&           ranges (2 numbers separated by a dash "\-"), or a comma
\&           separated list of values or ranges.  In a few cases,
\&           negative values are appropriate.
\&
\&           This is best illustrated by example.
\&
\&             0:0:2:1:0:0:0        every 2 weeks and 1 day
\&             0:0:0:0:5:30:0       every 5 hours and 30 minutes
\&             0:0:0:2*12:30:0      every 2 days at 12:30 (each day)
\&             3*1:0:2:12:0:0       every 3 years on Jan 2 at noon
\&             0:1*0:2:12,14:0:0    2nd of every month at 12:00 and 14:00
\&             1:0:0*45:0:0:0       45th day of every year
\&             0:1*4:2:0:0:0        4th tuesday (day 2) of every month
\&             0:1*\-1:2:0:0:0       last tuesday of every month
\&             0:1:0*\-2:0:0:0       2nd to last day of every month

.IP "\(bu" 4
new(%p)
.Sp
This method takes a hash of parameters.  The following options are
valid:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- name ($)
.Sp
The name of the object (not the filename!).  Required.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- size ($)
.Sp
The maxium (or close to) size the log file can grow too.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- max ($)
.Sp
The maxium number of log files to create.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- \s-1TZ\s0 ($)
.Sp
The TimeZone time based calculations should be done in. This should match
Date::Manip's concept of timezones and of course your machines timezone.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- DatePattern ($)
.Sp
The DatePattern as defined above.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- min_level ($)
.Sp
The minimum logging level this object will accept.  See the
Log::Dispatch documentation for more information.  Required.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- max_level ($)
.Sp
The maximum logging level this obejct will accept.  See the
Log::Dispatch documentation for more information.  This is not
required.  By default the maximum is the highest possible level (which
means functionally that the object has no maximum).
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- filename ($)
.Sp
The filename to be opened for writing. This is the base name. Rotated log
files will be renamed filename.1 thru to filename.\f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR. Where max is the
paramater defined above.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- mode ($)
.Sp
The mode the file should be opened with.  Valid options are 'write',
\&'>', 'append', '>>', or the relevant constants from Fcntl.  The
default is 'write'.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- autoflush ($)
.Sp
Whether or not the file should be autoflushed.  This defaults to true.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- callbacks( \e& or [ \e&, \e&, ... ] )
.Sp
This parameter may be a single subroutine reference or an array
reference of subroutine references.  These callbacks will be called in
the order they are given and passed a hash containing the following keys:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& ( message => $log_message, level => $log_level )
.Ve
.Sp
The callbacks are expected to modify the message and then return a
single scalar containing that modified message.  These callbacks will
be called when either the \f(CW\*(C`log\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`log_to\*(C'\fR methods are called and
will only be applied to a given message once.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\-\- \s-1DEBUG\s0 ($)
.Sp
Turn on lots of warning messages to \s-1STDERR\s0 about what this module is
doing if set to 1. Really only useful to me.
.IP "\(bu" 4
log_message( message => $ )
.Sp
Sends a message to the appropriate output.  Generally this shouldn't
be called directly but should be called through the \f(CW\*(C`log()\*(C'\fR method
(in Log::Dispatch::Output).
.IP "\(bu" 4
setDatePattern( $ or [ $, $, ... ] )
.Sp
Set a new suite of recurrances for file rotation. You can pass in a
single string or a reference to an array of strings. Multiple recurrences
can also be define within a single string by seperating them with a
semi-colon (;)
.Sp
See the discussion above regarding the setDatePattern paramater for more
details.
