Fixed a bug where the gmtoff method of getting the local timezone was broken.
Martin Zinser.
.Sp
Fixed the 'env' method of determining the local time zone to allow the
value to be an offset of seconds since \s-1UTC\s0.  This allows the \s-1VMS\s0

.Sp
Removed the \s-1SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE\s0 method from \s-1VMS\s0 since the value stored there
is not the name of a timezone (it's a rule in a non-standard format).  Based
on discussion with Martin Zinser.

where old usages were getting tested before current usage.

.IP "\fB(*) (!) Reworked recurrences\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) Reworked recurrences"
Recurrences were reworked in a (slightly) backward incompatible way to
improve their usefulness (and to make them conform to the expected
results). Most recurrences will work the same as previously, but a few will
differ. Most of this was suggested by Jay Jacobs.
.Sp
A recurring event is now calculated relative to the base date, \s-1NOT\s0 relative
to a previous event. For example, if a recurrence occurs every month, and
the base date was Jan 31, then previously, recurring events would have
been (in a non-leap year):
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   D(0)                   = Jan 31
\&   D(1)  = D(0) + 1 month = Feb 28
\&   D(2)  = D(1) + 1 month = Mar 28
\&   ...
.Ve
.Sp
The new behavior is:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   D(0)                       = Jan 31
\&   D(1)  = D(0) + 1*(1 month) = Feb 28
\&   D(2)  = D(0) + 2*(1 month) = Mar 31
\&   ...
.Ve
.Sp
Previously, if a base date were not specified, it was not determined
from the date range. Now, the start date of the date range acts as the
base date.
.Sp
The meaning of the base date has changed slightly. It is much more
meaningful and useful now.
.Sp
Added iterator functions.  Daniel LaLiberte
.Sp
The RecurNumFudgeDays variable is no longer used and is deprecated.

.IP "\fB(*) Combined 5.xx and 6.xx releases into one distribution\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) Combined 5.xx and 6.xx releases into one distribution"
Because the automatic module management tools cpan/cpanp would try
to upgrade Date::Manip to the most recent version, and the most
recent version will only work if perl 5.10.0 or higher is installed,
both the 5.xx and 6.xx releases are now combined into a single
distribution.
.Sp
This is described more fully in the Date::Manip::Problems document.
.IP "\fB(!) Zones specified by offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) Zones specified by offset"
In all operations involving time zones, the time zone must be determined.
By default, it would take all of the information available (date, \s-1ISDST\s0,
etc.) and determine the most likely time zone. It would take every time zone
that matched each piece of information, starting with those that matched
in a standard time followed by those that matched in a daylight saving
time.
.Sp
When zones are specified by an offset, a standard time would always match
since there are standard time zones that match all year long (the military
time zones A\-Z and the standard time zones of the form Etc/GMT+01). As a
result, a daylight saving time match would never occur.
.Sp
Since (if the date falls during a daylight saving time period) you usually
want to use a time zone that has that offset in daylight saving time,
the default is now to check daylight saving time zones first, followed
by standard times.
.Sp
See the Date::Manip::TZ manual (under the zone method) for more
information.

In Date::Manip 5.xx, the \f(CW%z\fR format in UnixDate printed the offset in
the form \-0500. In 6.00, I changed that to \-05:00:00, but this broke
\&\s-1RFC\s0 822 compliance.
.Sp
I've changed \f(CW%z\fR back to \-0500, and introduced a new format (%N) which
returns \-05:00:00.
.Sp
Incidentally, this is the \s-1LAST\s0 unused letter, so I am now going to
have to either stop adding formats, or add some extended format
syntax. Not sure yet which, but this may involve a backwards
incompatible change in the future.

I believe the first person to suggest writing Date::Manip as an \s-1OO\s0
module was Eduard Derksen.
.Sp
Delta_Format initialization done outside of the function.  Eric Boehm
.Sp
Added \f(CW$subtract\fR to calculation routines. First suggested by Steve Berlage.
.Sp
Added ability to set individual parts of the date (Date::Manip::Date::set).
First suggested by Martin Thurn.

UnixDate (i.e. Date::Manip::Date::printf) only calculates formats when
they are needed.  Eduard Derksen

Parsing will skip some date/time formats if requested. This was first
suggested by Eduard Derksen.
.Sp
It has been suggested several times to support multiple languages,
multiple config files, or multiple sets of Date_Init
options. These suggestions (by Meng Fang, Ed Avis, Christian
Campbell, and perhaps others) were at the back of my mind as I
developed the Date::Manip::Base class.
.Sp
The regular expressions are all i18n friendly in anticipation of much
better support for localization. First suggested by Alex Kapranoff.
.Sp
Parsing a date ('today', 'Monday') gives a time of '00:00:00'. Suggested
by Mark Aitchison.
