.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
In dependency systems, it can often be very useful to calculate
an aggregate or sum for one or all items. For example, to find
the \*(L"naive install weight\*(R" of a Perl distribution (where \*(L"naive\*(R"
means you treat each distribution equally), you would want the
distribtion (1) + all its dependencies (n) + all \fBtheir\fR
dependencies (n2) recursively downwards.
.PP
If calculated using a normal Algorithm::Dependency object, the
result would be (in a simple systems) equal to:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # Create your normal (non\-ordered alg:dep)
\&  my $dependency = Algorithm::Dependency\->new( ... );
\&  
\&  # Find the naive weight for an item
\&  my $weight = scalar($dependency\->schedule(\*(Aqitemname\*(Aq));
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Algorithm::Dependency::Weight\*(C'\fR provides a way of doing this
with a little more sophistication, and in a way that should work
reasonable well across all the Algorithm::Dependency family.
.PP
Please note that the this might be a little (or more than a little)
slower than it could be for the limited case of generating weights
for all of the items at once in a dependency system with no selected
items and no circular dependencies. \s-1BUT\s0 you can at least rely on
this class to do the job properly regardless of the particulars of
the situation, which is probably more important.
.SS "\s-1METHODS\s0"
.IX Subsection "METHODS"
.ie n .SS "new @params"
.el .SS "new \f(CW@params\fP"
.IX Subsection "new @params"
The \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR constructor creates a new \f(CW\*(C`Algorithm::Dependency::Weight\*(C'\fR
object. It takes a number of key/value pairs as parameters (although
at the present time only one).
.ie n .IP "source => $Source" 4
.el .IP "source => \f(CW$Source\fR" 4
.IX Item "source => $Source"
The \f(CW\*(C`source\*(C'\fR param is mostly the same as for Algorithm::Dependency.
The one addition is that as a source you can provide an
Algorithm::Dependency object, and the Algorithm::Dependency::Source
for that will be used.
.PP
Returns a new \f(CW\*(C`Algorithm::Dependency::Weight\*(C'\fR object, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error.
.SS "source"
.IX Subsection "source"
The \f(CW\*(C`source\*(C'\fR accessor returns the source used for the weight calculations.
.PP
This will be either the one passed to the constructor, or the source from
inside the \f(CW\*(C`Algorithm::Dependency\*(C'\fR object passed as the \f(CW\*(C`source\*(C'\fR param
(\fBnot\fR the object itself, \fBits\fR source).
.ie n .SS "weight $name"
.el .SS "weight \f(CW$name\fP"
.IX Subsection "weight $name"
The \f(CW\*(C`weight\*(C'\fR method takes the name of a single item and calculates its
weight based on the configuration of the \f(CW\*(C`Algorithm::Dependency::Weight\*(C'\fR
object.
.PP
Returns the weight as a scalar (which in the naive case will be an
integer, but in more complex uses may be any real number), or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
on error.
.ie n .SS "weight_merged @names"
.el .SS "weight_merged \f(CW@names\fP"
.IX Subsection "weight_merged @names"
The \f(CW\*(C`weight_merged\*(C'\fR method takes the name of a set of items and
calculates an aggregated weight for the whole set.
.PP
Returns the weight as a scalar, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error.
.ie n .SS "weight_hash @names"
.el .SS "weight_hash \f(CW@names\fP"
.IX Subsection "weight_hash @names"
The \f(CW\*(C`weight_hash\*(C'\fR method takes a list of item names, and calculates
their weights.
.PP
Returns a reference to a \f(CW\*(C`HASH\*(C'\fR with the item names as keys and weights
as values, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error.
.SS "weight_all"
.IX Subsection "weight_all"
The \f(CW\*(C`weight_all\*(C'\fR method provides the one-shot method for getting the
weights of all items at once. Please note that this does not do
anything different or special, but is slightly faster than iterating
yourself.
.PP
Returns a reference to a \f(CW\*(C`HASH\*(C'\fR with the item names as keys and weights
as values, or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on error.
