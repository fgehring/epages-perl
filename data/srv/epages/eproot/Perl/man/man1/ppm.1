.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
ppm is a utility intended to simplify the tasks of locating, installing,
upgrading and removing software packages.  It is a front-end to the
functionality provided in \s-1PPM\s0.pm.  It can determine if the most recent
version of a software package is installed on a system, and can install
or upgrade that package from a local or remote host.
.PP
ppm runs in one of two modes: an interactive shell from which commands
may be entered; and command-line mode, in which one specific action is
performed per invocation of the program.
.PP
ppm uses files containing an extended form of the Open Software
Description (\s-1OSD\s0) specification for information about software packages.
These description files, which are written in Extensible Markup
Language (\s-1XML\s0) code, are referred to as '\s-1PPD\s0' files.  Information about
\&\s-1OSD\s0 can be found at the W3C web site (at the time of this writing,
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE\-OSD.html).  The extensions to \s-1OSD\s0 used by ppm
are documented in \s-1PPM\s0.ppd.
.SH "Using PPM"
.IX Header "Using PPM"
.IP "Interactive mode" 4
.IX Item "Interactive mode"
If ppm is invoked with no command specified, it is started in interactive
mode.  If the '\-\-location' argument is specified, it is used as the
search location, otherwise the repositories specified in the \s-1PPM\s0 data file
are used.
.Sp
The syntax of \s-1PPM\s0 commands is the same in interactive mode as it is in
command-line mode.  The 'help' command lists the available commands.
.Sp
ppm commands may be abbreviated to their shortest unique form.
.IP "Installing" 4
.IX Item "Installing"
.Vb 1
\& ppm install [\-\-location=location] package1 [... packageN]
.Ve
.Sp
Installs the specified software packages. Attempts to install from the 
\&\s-1URL\s0 or directory 'location' if the '\-\-location' option is specfied.
.Sp
The 'package' arguments may be either package names ('foo'), pathnames 
(p:/packages/foo.ppd) or URLs (http://www.ActiveState.com/packages/foo.ppd)
to specific \s-1PPD\s0 files.
.Sp
In the case where a package name is specified, and the '\-\-location'
option is not used, ppm will refer to the default repository locations.
.Sp
See also: 'confirm' option.
.IP "Removing" 4
.IX Item "Removing"
.Vb 1
\& ppm remove package1 [... packageN]
.Ve
.Sp
Reads information from the \s-1PPD\s0 file for the named software package and
removes the package from the system.
.Sp
See also: 'confirm' option.
.IP "Verifying" 4
.IX Item "Verifying"
.Vb 1
\& ppm verify [\-\-location=location] [\-\-upgrade] [\-\-force] [package1 ... packageN]
.Ve
.Sp
Verifies that the currently installed packages are up to date.  If no
packages are specified as arguments, all installed packages will be verified.
.Sp
If the '\-\-upgrade' option is specified, any package for which an upgrade 
is available will be upgraded.
.Sp
If the '\-\-location' option is specified, upgrades will be looked for at 
the specified \s-1URL\s0 or directory.
.Sp
If the '\-\-force' option is specified, all currently installed packages will 
be reinstalled regardless of whether they are out of date or not.
.Sp
See also: 'confirm' option.
.IP "Querying" 4
.IX Item "Querying"
.Vb 1
\& ppm query [\-\-case|nocase] [\-\-abstract|author] PATTERN
.Ve
.Sp
Searches for '\s-1PATTERN\s0' (a regular expression) in the name of any installed 
package.  If a search is successful, information about the matching 
package(s) is displayed.  If '\s-1PATTERN\s0' is omitted, information about
all installed packages will be displayed.
.Sp
If either '\-\-abstract' or '\-\-author' is specified, \s-1PATTERN\s0 will be 
searched for in the <\s-1ABSTRACT\s0> or <\s-1AUTHOR\s0> tags of the installed packages.
.Sp
The '\-\-case' and '\-\-nocase' options can be used to override the default
case-sensitivity search settings.
.Sp
See also: 'case' option.
.IP "Searching" 4
.IX Item "Searching"
.Vb 1
\& ppm search [\-\-case|nocase] [\-\-location=location] [\-\-abstract|author] PATTERN
.Ve
.Sp
Displays a list of any packages matching '\s-1PATTERN\s0' (a regular expression)
available from the specified location.  If '\s-1PATTERN\s0' is omitted, information 
about all available packages will be displayed.
.Sp
If the '\-\-location' option is specified, the specified \s-1URL\s0 or directory
will be searched.  If '\-\-location' is not specified, the repository location 
as specified in the \s-1PPM\s0 data file will be searched.
.Sp
If either '\-\-abstract' or '\-\-author' is specified, \s-1PATTERN\s0 will be 
searched for in the <\s-1ABSTRACT\s0> or <\s-1AUTHOR\s0> tags of the available packages.
.Sp
The '\-\-case' and '\-\-nocase' options can be used to override the default
case-sensitivity search settings.
.Sp
See also: 'case' option.
.IP "Error Recovery" 4
.IX Item "Error Recovery"
.Vb 2
\& ppm genconfig
\& ppm getconfig
.Ve
.Sp
The genconfig command will print a valid \s-1PPM\s0 config file (ppm.xml) to \s-1STDOUT\s0.
This can be useful if the \s-1PPM\s0 config file ever gets damaged leaving \s-1PPM\s0
unusable.
.Sp
If required, this command should be run from a shell prompt:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    C:\ePerl\esite\elib> ppm genconfig > ppm.xml
.Ve
.Sp
The getconfig command prints the location of the \s-1PPM\s0 configuration file
used at \s-1PPM\s0 startup.
.IP "Options" 4
.IX Item "Options"
.Vb 1
\& ppm set [option value]
.Ve
.Sp
Sets or displays current options.  With no arguments, current option
settings are displayed.
.Sp
Available options:
.Sp
.Vb 2
